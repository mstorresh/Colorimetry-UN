# Colorimetry-UN
code to view the RGB values of a ColorChecker of photos from different cameras

# Code create by:
- T. Acero Cuellar
- M. Torres Hernandez

# Idea

The purpose is to characterize the colorimetry of different cameras, for this purpose we take pictures with different cameras to a ColorChecker. Then from a python code we analyze the RGB values of each color square to obtain an error with the real values of the ColorChecker.

# Experiment

For the colorimetric characterization of different cameras, it was essential to take photographs of a 24-color reference grid, known as ColorChecker, printed on photographic paper. The Nikon D3200 digital camera and the HuaweiP9 cell phone camera were used.




# To Clarify

The experimental setup required for each part of the characterization was carried out with implements present at home or easily available via internet, considering the restrictions caused by COVID-19 in the first half of 2020.
